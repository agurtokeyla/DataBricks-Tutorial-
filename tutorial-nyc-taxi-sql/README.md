# Databricks Tutorial – Query and Visualize Data from a Notebook

## Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to use a notebook in :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} to query, explore, and visualize structured data using SQL.  
The notebook uses Databricks’ built-in NYC Taxi sample dataset to perform exploratory queries and inspect trip-level information.

## Objectives
- Query structured data using SQL in a Databricks notebook
- Explore key fields such as pickup/dropoff times, trip distance, and fare amounts
- Visualize query results directly within the notebook environment
- Learn basic Databricks notebook workflow and execution

---

## Dataset

**Table:** `samples.nytaxi.trips`

**Example fields include:**
- `tpep_pickup_datetime`
- `tpep_dropoff_datetime`
- `trip_distance`
- `fare_amount`
- `pickup_zip`
- `dropoff_zip`
