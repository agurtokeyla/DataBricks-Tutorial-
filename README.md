# Databricks Tutorials Portfolio

This repository contains my hands-on walkthroughs of Databricks tutorials, adapted and completed using the **Databricks Free Serverless Starter Workspace**.  
Each tutorial includes code, screenshots, and explanations showing how the workflow was completed or adapted to work without Unity Catalog or persistent table storage.

The goal of this repo is to build a clear learning portfolio for SQL, Python, Spark, and BI workflows inside Databricks.
